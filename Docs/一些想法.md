## face in your day-to-day coding?

> Code Switching! :D No not cultural code switching. As an engineer focused on tooling and infrastructure my day is often split between writing or reviewing code written in Python, PHP, or Javascript. Switching between these languages doesn’t present a problem when I’m simply looking to find mistakes or improve the overall quality. The challenge I have is the missed opportunity to learn and practice critical thinking. Questioning if a PR is the best, most efficient and maintainable way this code can be written. Finding the time to do this at a fast paced startup is really tough.
