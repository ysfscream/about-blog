# 一些想法

## face in your day-to-day coding

> Code Switching! :D No not cultural code switching. As an engineer focused on tooling and infrastructure my day is often split between writing or reviewing code written in Python, PHP, or Javascript. Switching between these languages doesn’t present a problem when I’m simply looking to find mistakes or improve the overall quality. The challenge I have is the missed opportunity to learn and practice critical thinking. Questioning if a PR is the best, most efficient and maintainable way this code can be written. Finding the time to do this at a fast paced startup is really tough.

## focus

做事 学习 专注！专注！！专注！！！

## Refactor

> Code refactoring is a controlled technique for improving the design of an existing code base. Its essence is applying a series of small behavior-preserving transformations, each of which “too small to be worth doing”. However, the cumulative effect of each of these transformations is quite significant. By doing them in small steps you reduce the risk of introducing errors.

Long story short, try to review your own code and improve it without impacting the functionality. Faster, cleaner, more readable, modular.

## Carefulness

细心！细心！！细心！！！

## Mistake

 I found out that the most valuable way to improve myself was to fail again and again. Trust me, some mistakes are almost impossible to avoid, and that’s totally normal.Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. You’ll keep making them time and time again, but less and less often. You never stop having to learn new things and adapting to new technology changes, but this is the beauty of our job. Learning new things every single day.

## 学会写下来

代码，项目，样式，行不通的概念，都可以先在纸上和白板上构造出来，缕清思路，逻辑清晰，

## 代码追求

写让人看的懂, 好阅读的代码

## 所谓编程
就是将一组需求分解成一组函数和数据结构的技能

## 「管」和「带」的区别
所谓『管』是"我不懂某个领域，但我知道你懂，你必须给我做好"，而『带』则是"我特别懂这个领域，我知道你不懂，我要教你做得更好"

## 工程经验
工程经验涉及到技术选型、架构设计、性能优化，CI/CD，日志监控、系统测试等，这些是跟工程相关的方法论。
